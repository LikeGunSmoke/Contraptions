# Classic Contraptions

As the sole developer I created Classic Contraptions as a fun learning experiment and homage to the games I enjoyed playing as a kid. Classic Contraptions is a 3D single played game built with React Three Fiber, Cannon JS, and Redux. If you like the project please feel free to fork it and build your own levels, I'd be glad to collaborate and help eachother learn as well. 

## Installation

OS X & Linux

From the root directory type:

```sh
npm install
```
Then:

```sh
npm start
```

Your game server will be running locally on port 3000. Navigate your browser to http://localhost:3000/ to enter the game lobby.
